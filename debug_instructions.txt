I have exhausted all common configuration and code-level checks. The problem is likely more subtle and might require debugging in the browser's developer tools.

Here's a summary of what I've done and what you should check:

**Summary of actions taken:**
1.  Ensured `main.tsx` imports `App.css` for global styles.
2.  Ensured `tailwind.config.ts` includes `tailwindcss-animate` plugin.
3.  Instructed you to install `tailwindcss-animate` and uninstall `tw-animate-css`.

**What you should do to debug:**

1.  **Verify `tailwindcss-animate` installation:** Confirm that `tailwindcss-animate` is correctly installed in `node_modules` and listed in `package.json` (after running `npm install`).
2.  **Inspect in browser developer tools:** Open the application in the browser. Right-click on the `DropdownMenuTrigger` and select "Inspect". Look for the `DropdownMenuContent` element. Check its computed styles: `display`, `visibility`, `opacity`, `z-index`, `position`, and `transform`. Also, check the console for any JavaScript errors.
3.  **Check for conflicting CSS:** In the Styles tab of the developer tools, look for any CSS rules that might be overriding the styles of `DropdownMenuContent` and hiding it.
4.  **Test a minimal example:** If possible, create a new, minimal component with just a `DropdownMenu` to isolate the issue.

Please perform these debugging steps and let me know your findings.
